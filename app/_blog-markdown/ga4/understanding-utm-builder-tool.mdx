## Introduction

UTM codes can be a nightmare to manage. I've made it so simple a child could do it. In the next few minutes, you'll learn how to simplify the process of tracking your marketing campaigns, pinpoint your most converting traffic sources, and optimize your marketing spend. This isn't just about understanding UTM parameters—it's about revolutionizing how you approach marketing analytics.

## What Is a UTM Builder?

UTM parameters are simply tags you add to a URL. When your link is clicked, the tags are sent back to Google Analytics and tracked. Our UTM Builder allows you to create these tags quickly and efficiently, ensuring that no part of your campaign goes unmonitored.

## Getting Started with the UTM Builder

Our UTM Builder is built with React, providing a seamless and interactive experience. Here's how you can use it to create UTM-tagged URLs in a few easy steps:

1. **Step 1: Enter Your Website URL**: Start by entering the full website URL where you want to direct your traffic. This should be the landing page specifically designed for your campaign.

2. **Step 2: Select Your Campaign Mode**: You can manually enter the parameters or choose from presets like Facebook, Pinterest, Google, or TikTok. Our tool will autofill some fields based on the mode you select to speed up the process.

3. **Step 3: Define Campaign Parameters**: Fill out the details of your campaign:
   - **Campaign Source**: Where is the traffic coming from? (e.g., google, newsletter)
   - **Campaign Medium**: How is it being delivered? (e.g., cpc, banner, email)
   - **Campaign Name**: What are you promoting? (e.g., spring_sale)
   - **Campaign Term (Optionally)**: If you're doing paid search, specify the keywords.
   - **Campaign Content (Optionally)**: Use this to differentiate between similar content or links within the same ad.

4. **Step 4: Generate Your UTM Link**: Once all the relevant fields are filled, the tool automatically generates your UTM-tagged URL. You can see this in the ‘Generated UTM Link' section.

5. **Step 5: Copy to Clipboard**: With a simple click of the “Copy to Clipboard” button, your new URL with UTM parameters is ready to be pasted wherever you plan to use it.

## Why Use Our UTM Builder?

- **Simplicity**: Our tool is user-friendly, allowing you to generate UTM links without the need for in-depth knowledge of how UTM parameters work.
