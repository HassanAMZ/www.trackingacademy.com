To track the traffic acquisition for Facebook ads on GA4 for iOS14+ users using custom reports in google analytics 4. In this article, we will walk through the steps to create a custom report and filter the data to view the transactions and analyze the performance of the FB Ad campaigns.

## Origin of the issue

As a result of iOS14 changes, advertisers running campaigns will be affected by limitations on data sharing. The user can opt-out or opt-in of the tracking, either way, the source of the traffic is lost. To set up the UTM parameters on Facebook, follow the link:

2. [Google Ads URL suffixes for dynamic UTM parameters](/blog/google-ads/google-ads-url-suffixes-utm-for-dynamic-paramters)

## Custom GA4 Report

Once, the UTMs have been published in the Facebook ads manager, it takes google analytics 24hours to process the data into a report. however we can process and set up the reports. Go to Explore> Free Form Reports.
