## Introduction

The study Plan must have the following seven sections to get approved by the university and Chinese Scholarship Council in China. I have written this blog as an example, the content used in this is from an actual study plan that I submitted to NPU (National Polytechnic University Xi’an) for my Masters in Control Sciences and Engineering in 2021-2023 Session.

You can use this guide as a reference and put in your information and credentials and submit the Study Plan to your relevant university for admission. This Study plan has a 100% Admission Success Rate.

## Academic Background

I have recently completed my B.Sc. Electrical Engineering in September 2018 from Government College University Lahore with an accumulative GPA of 2.97 out of 4.00. During my study period, I was an active student often involved in extracurricular and co-curricular activities. My batch organized several functions in the department like annual dinner, culture day, and quiz competitions in which I was a member of the discipline committee. Outside the university, I have organized an event “Shukriya Pakistan” in Lahore with my team at R&D Youth Connect Punjab on the 14th of August (Independence Day of Pakistan).

For my final year project, I led a group of 4 people in modeling an IoT-based Device for detection and transmission of Patient Health Parameters to cloud and android application with data logging. It can also be controlled manually using a mobile app (which we designed especially for the robot) via Bluetooth.

The system is to be designed to measure the vital health parameters of patients and to transmit it to the people concerned like doctors/nurses over the thinger.io app and the thinger.io cloud system. Health in underdeveloped countries positively, scientific-based is a major issue and often neglected instead of other facilities. In countries like ours, it is of paramount importance to develop and help build a comprehensive patient monitoring system like this to assist in the time of emergency.

During my semesters I have worked on beautiful projects and for digital electronics projects, I built a fuzzy controller of DC to DC buck-boost converter to control the output voltage of the buck-boost converter. During the 4th semester, I have built a 7 segment LED display using combinational logic circuits for a digital logic design project to stop the logic circuit is designed with 4 inputs and 7 outputs each representing an input to the display IC.

I have participated in the annual Apex exhibition for a project competition during my graduation. I have done my high school education from a superior group of colleges Sheikhupura with 79% grades. I have been the class coordinator for my college and got certifications for character and Management.

Besides the formal education, I have completed 4 certifications on LinkedIn learning related to programming languages such as JavaScript and python.

## Personality

I have a competitive personality and I love to talk on various topics and discover the views of other people and cultures. I have a huge interest in language and human psychology in general. I love to read about religion and cultural-historic backgrounds. I am physically active and enjoy sports and working out in the gym. I have a huge interest in food and I love to discover different kinds of flavors in different cultures and areas.

I have also taken part in many social and political events which have improved my team management and communication skills a lot and made me an overall better person with a friendly personality.

I have worked in the industry for about six months and that has helped me create a problem-solving mind instead of a problem reporting person. My experience in freelance has helped me to work with various clients throughout the world and gain experience from their problems and understand the point of view of different people.

## Study Plan in China

I would like to apply for the Master’s degree in Control Engineering and Computer Vision in China because of my undergraduate study, my internship experience, and my university projects. I came to know a great variety of applications of machine learning nowadays not only in computer transformation but also in the digital world. My aim to work is to explore this field further through theoretical and practical work.

During my studies, with my abilities I will try to come up with the best of everything; to accompany the professors and university colleagues in executing the research and exploring immense exciting questions in this field.

After completion of my master’s degree, I desire to take part in maximizing my country’s research technology in this field to improve its economical state and elevate the living standards of my people. I believe that this program will provide me the chance to know Control Engineering and will bestow me the opportunity to use my knowledge in a positive way. I hope that my learning will be vastly increased with this study and I will gain more valuable experience which will help me deal with difficult situations, people and problems.

To gain deeper knowledge within a particular specialized area of control science, and gain insight into literature, research methods and a good handle on current topics within the field specifically the role of machine learning (machine learning control) and artificial intelligence in automation.
To gain practical experience in automation research.
To gain experience in critical, scientific based work with practical implementations.
Lastly, the goal of graduate research is also to prepare for continued activity both within and outside of academia.

## Reasons for selecting Control Engineering

To improve the industrial situation in Pakistan where most of the manufacturing plants are based on machinery built in China and being exported to Pakistan.

In the past year, I have worked in the plastic industry of Pakistan in Karachi and I have discovered that 80% of the machines being used are manufactured in China but those models are from the early 2000 and have not been upgraded due to the poor economic situation of my country. Whereas some industries which could afford a modern engineering Masterpiece are from China or not able to understand and fully control the
use of the machine for their advantages.

The proper learning of control engineering is going to help me in better understanding the fundamentals and working principles of modern machines being used in industry and to introduce Innovation and easiness for the workers and community in the industry. Having a Grasp on modern tools for control engineering can enable me to become a helpful part of the industry in solving problems that have been faced by the plastic
The manufacturing industry in Pakistan.

## Reasons for selecting China

There is a strong bond between Pakistan and China especially nowadays when a vast number of new projects have started in Pakistan with the help of Chinese companies.

From the newspaper and media, I have come to observe a little bit about the people of China and I am impressed by their hardworking nature and their festive hospitality. China is a true example for developing countries. The fast-growing economy, technological innovations, and global ranking education institutes of China with good reputations make a good aspiration for students like me for better career perspectives.

This behavior has boosted my confidence greatly and I am highly motivated with my decision to study in China. Furthermore, Chinese diverse cultural values, famous and gentle hospitality, and Pakistan-China all-weather friendly relations since long, acceptance and peace to both sides in great clarity and harmony make China feel like my second homeland. Also, I have the full support of my family over this decision. All these reasons put together to make China an ideal place for me to pursue graduate studies.

China maintains a strong infrastructure for quality education not only in Asia but around the world particularly in engineering sciences. Chinese universities have made their way to the higher ranks of QS World and Asian Universities rankings and that depicts their quality research culture, strong international links, and language flexibility for international students.
China provides quality education at minimal cost and this makes it an attractive destination for me. China Scholarship Council has made large pots of financial support available and additionally the residential facilities it provides, will make me more comfortable and enable me to channel my efforts to research and development.
Another way in which Chinese universities are catering to international students and aiming to better integrate local and foreign students is to provide more courses taught in English, which opens up more opportunities for greater interactions inside and outside of the classrooms for all students.
Last but not the least, studying in China will help me gain first-hand experience in rising world power, prove my readiness to a global educational workplace, build a network of contacts in China and elsewhere, learn Mandarin and experience a cross-cultural environment.

## Career Objectives

My career objectives are:

Upon graduation, I plan to immediately opt for teaching as a profession. That will serve me two purposes, firstly it will give me a chance to materialize the research that I will undertake in my graduate studies, are and secondly, I will be able to mentor quality research to the future generation which will be a source of felicitation for me.
Parallel to my mentoring activities, I aim to pursue an entrepreneurial venture too. Considering the security and surveillance situation of my country, I aim to open an enterprise that will incorporate my knowledge and expertise to devise feasible solutions to security problems.
After getting some practical experience, I intend to pursue a doctoral degree as a long-term goal. The world is advancing so rapidly in technology and other aspects, so it is necessary to acquire excellence to thrive and keep pace.

I hope my application will receive your favorable consideration and I will be happy to provide any other information that you may require. I am looking forward to your reply.
