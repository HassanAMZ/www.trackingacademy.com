Freelancing isn't for everyone. It's a bold statement, but it's a belief I hold firmly. However, if you happen to be one of my close family members or friends, you'd hear a different recommendation: jump into freelancing, skill or no skill.

_How to Take the Unconventional Path in Freelancing_

## My Unconventional Freelancing Advice

The general advice given by most YouTubers to budding freelancers is to pick up a skill, master it, develop a portfolio, and then grow. This is the traditional freelancing path. But that's not what I'd suggest. Instead, my advice is rooted in the concepts of outsourcing and agency building.

Throughout my life, I've noticed that trying to do things by the book or following a step-by-step approach has rarely ever worked for me. Taking gradual steps like starting with $5, then $10, and so on, has never been my style. I prefer taking a giant 10-step leap forward and then maybe retracing a step if needed.

## Taking a 10-Step Jump

Andrew Tate once pointed out in a video that no matter how much you work, you can't buy a sports car by simply working hard. They're too expensive, and accumulating wealth in a step-by-step manner just doesn't cut it. To truly get wealthy, one needs a mindset shift. Instead of focusing on making money, concentrate on building wealth.

## Building Agencies

When family or friends approach me for freelancing advice, especially if they've never earned money before, I steer them towards agency building. Instead of specializing in one particular skill, I'd advise them to master client relations and understand platforms like UPWORK. Building multiple agencies, partnering with skilled freelancers, is the key.

In any agency, two main roles exist: client acquisition and technical execution. To simplify this, consider a digital marketing niche like Facebook ads. One role focuses on managing the Facebook ads, while the other centers on client interactions, presentations, and reporting. The client management aspect can't be automated and is where the real value lies. Technical execution, however, can be outsourced to skilled freelancers.

## Niche Selection & Recurring Clients

It's critical to choose niches that have recurring clients, meaning those that will pay you regularly, be it monthly or based on performance. Avoid one-time gigs like web development or graphic design. Once you secure a few clients, you can outsource the technical work to a team or freelancer. You manage client interactions, and they handle the actual work. This way, with multiple teams under you, the monthly earning potential can range from $25,000 to $50,000.

## Is This Model Applicable?

While this model sounds promising, its applicability is subjective. I haven't personally employed this strategy, but I know friends who've been successful with it, pushing their agency to earn up to $50,000. However, they generally focus on one agency. I envision this model being more diversified, partnering with multiple individuals or teams.

## My Personal Freelancing Journey

My journey in freelancing was quite traditional. I acquired a skill, honed it, secured clients, and now, I'm at a point where I can charge $110 per client and have ample work to sustain me. But just because this path worked for me doesn't mean it's the only route to success in freelancing.
