## Client Name

Starting the Cover Letter with a greeting such as “Hi” or “Hello” followed by the name of the client is appropriate. Do not use greetings such as “Hi Dear”, “Hey Sir/Madam” in case you are not able to find the name of the client.

You can find the name of the client if you will scroll down to the bottom of the Job Post and look for the client recent Job, there you can find the name of the client in feedbacks. If you failed to find the name Just use “Hi”.

```
Hi, [Name of the Client]

```

## Attaching a Video

The most import thing is providing a video link to the client, where you will be discussing all the details about their job, issues, solution and your past experience. Having a video attached to a proposal adds more value to your cover letter and it built a relationship more than words with a client.

I have seen a conversion rate of over 60% with loom video attached in the cover letter.

## Call to action

You can also reemphasis their needs, by using the same words, the client has used in the job title. Its also important to add some sort of a call to action, usually I find it better to invite the client for a meeting on zoom or google meets.
