I have been using this cover letter for over 3 months now and this has proven to be successful with a 33% ratio. One out of every three proposals that I send using this template gets me to the client-interview phase. Once I get to the client-interview phase, Upwork awards me with 10 connects, and most likely I win the contract too.

This cover letter i use was inspired by a top-rated freelancer on Upwork, and [here is a link to their YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGItwYOYB_E&list=PLCfjqPPfH_dYeX3RNc1JfnEjqKeYbb8A8&index=5). However, here is the breakdown of the cover letter, to me, these 8 aspects are the most important when writing the cover letter to a client.

Hi [Name of the Client],

You are having trouble setting datalayer in your bigcommerce store. Bigcommemrce doesn't provide a built-in solution for datalayer objects that can be used by Google tag manager. We can set up a datalayer using a paid plugin, write custom javascript code that will make get API calls, or check the default UA integration method.

I have recorded a short video for you: [Loom Video link]

Setting up enhanced e-commerce events, web tracking, and testing the setup takes 2-3 days, and the order usually takes 4 days at my end to be delivered (can be done quicker if there are no other pending projects). For setting up and configuring the browser events, it budgets at 150$ fixed cost, and for Server tracking, it budgets at 250$.

I'm a top-rated web analyst and have set up and configured 100+ websites with google tag manager, google analytics, and Facebook pixel in the span of the last 6 months. I have experience setting up conversion tracking, enhanced eCommerce events, outbound affiliate links tracking, Facebook, Google, Pinterest remarketing tags for ads.

Do you need a google tag manager expert?

Let's schedule a quick discovery call. Please provide 2 times this week that work for you.

## Client Name

Starting the Cover Letter with a greeting such as “Hi” or “Hello” followed by the name of the client is appropriate. Do not use greetings such as “Hi Dear”, “Hey Sir/Madam” in case you are not able to find the name of the client. You can find the name of the client if you will scroll down to the bottom of the Job Post and look for the client recent Job, there you can find the name of the client. If you failed to find the name Just use “Hi”.

```
Hi [Name of the Client],
```

## Summarizing the client issue

Once, you read the client's Job Post, summarize the whole problem in 1-3 sentences and briefly touch the pain point of the job. This will make the client realize that you understand the problem and can better solve the issue for them.

```
You are having trouble setting datalayer in your bigcommerce store.
```

## Mentioning the reasons for the problem

Once you briefly mention the clients' issues, now you can underline the causes for the problem that the client is facing. This will ensure them about your knowledge in the field and represent you as an expert. However, you do not need to mention all the details, just entice them about your information on the subject and their problem.

```
Bigcommemrce doesn't provide a built-in solution for datalayer objects that can be used by Google tag manager.
```

## Providing the solution

Now, you can provide them with the solution. I have felt that when you provide 2-3 solutions, the client is more likely to respond and place a contract. As the client is here on Upwork and looking for a freelancer, they are going to hire someone to fix the issue, and not solve it themselves. Therefore, providing the client with a solution also represents you as an expert.

```

```

## Attaching a Video

If there is some other information that you are required to add and typing it out will be long and time-consuming, you can record it in a loom video. Having a video attached to a proposal adds more value to your cover letter and it built a relationship more than words with a client.

```

## Talk about expertise and previous work

In this section, you will get a chance to talk about your past work and experience. Here is an example

```
I'm a top-rated web analyst and have set up and configured 100+ websites with google tag manager, google analytics, and Facebook pixel in the span of the last 6 months. I have experience setting up conversion tracking, enhanced eCommerce events, outbound affiliate links tracking, Facebook, Google, Pinterest remarketing tags for ads.
```

## Expected time, access required and Budget

Now you are required to give them an expected timeline, budget, and anything that you required from them.

```
Setting up enhanced e-commerce events, web tracking, and testing the setup takes 2-3 days, and the order usually takes 4 days at my end to be delivered(can be done quicker if there are no other pending projects). For setting up and configuring the browser events, it budgets at 150$ fixed cost, and for Server tracking, it budgets at 250$.
```

## Reference to a similar Job

This is the closing and here you want to reinforce the client to revisit your profile where they'll review your previous jobs. and will completely sellclient's out to your proposal.
