### Step 1: Configure Google Tag Manager Container

There are two ways to add the GTM container code to your WooCommerce store:

#### Option 1: Using a Plugin (Recommended)

- Install the plugin called "GTM for WP" by Thomas Gregor.
- Activate the plugin.
- In the plugin settings, add your Google Tag Manager container ID (found in your GTM account).
- Refresh the page to ensure the code is added.
- Verify the container code using a browser extension like Google Tag Assistant.

#### Option 2: Adding the Code Manually

- Caution: Editing theme files can break your website if done incorrectly. Only proceed if comfortable with code.
- Go to Appearances > Theme File Editor.
- Locate the file named `header.php`.
- Find the opening `<head>` tag.
- Paste your Google Tag Manager container code before the closing `</head>` tag.
- Save changes and refresh the page.
- Verify the container code using a browser extension.

### Step 2: Configure Facebook Pixel Tag

Similar to adding the GTM container, you have two options for configuring the Facebook Pixel tag:

#### Option 1: Using a Template (Recommended)

- Go to your Facebook Business Manager and navigate to the Event Manager.
- Copy your Facebook Pixel ID.
- In GTM, go to Tags and click New.
- Search for "Facebook Pixel" in the Community Template Gallery.
- Add the template to your workspace.
- Paste your Facebook Pixel ID into the designated field (or create a variable for it).
- Set the trigger to fire on all pages (All Pages).
- Name the tag (e.g., "Facebook Configuration Tag").
- Preview the tag using the GTM preview mode to test functionality.
- If satisfied, submit the changes to make them live on your website.

#### Option 2: Using Custom HTML

- In GTM, create a new tag with the tag type "Custom HTML."
- Copy the Facebook Pixel code from your Facebook Business Manager.
- Paste the code into the HTML field of the new tag.
- Set the trigger to fire on all pages (All Pages).
- Name the tag (e.g., "Custom HTML Facebook Configuration Tag").
- Preview the tag using the GTM preview mode to test functionality.
- If satisfied, submit the changes to make them live on your website.

### Step 3: Test the Integration

- Go to the Facebook Pixel Test Events section in your Business Manager.
- Enter your website URL and test different website sections (homepage, product pages, etc.).
- The Facebook Pixel Helper extension can also be used to verify if events are firing correctly.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll be able to configure Facebook Pixel on your WooCommerce store using Google Tag Manager. This allows you to track website visitor behavior and leverage that data for effective Facebook advertising campaigns.
