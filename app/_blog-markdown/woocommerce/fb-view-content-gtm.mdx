Welcome to the blog! My name is Hassan, and with my experience of configuring over 1,000 websites on platforms like Shopify, WordPress, WooCommerce, and custom builds, I have helped more than 300 clients and collaborated with 25 different agencies. In this guide, I will walk you through the process of setting up the Facebook Pixel's view item event on Google Tag Manager (GTM) for a WooCommerce website. This step-by-step tutorial is tailored for small business owners, digital marketing teams, and freelancers who want to track this essential event without the need to hire a professional.
