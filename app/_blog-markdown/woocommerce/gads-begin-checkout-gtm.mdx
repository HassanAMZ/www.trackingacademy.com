In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to configure the "Begin Checkout" event on your WooCommerce store using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Ads. By the end, you'll be able to track this event and optimize your ad campaigns effectively.

## Access Requirements

To begin, ensure you have the necessary access:

- Administrator access to your WordPress site.
- Access to your Google Tag Manager account.
- Admin or standard access to your Google Ads account.

### Steps to Verify Access

1. **WordPress:** Go to the back end of your WordPress site, click on "Users," and ensure your email has administrator access.
2. **GTM:** Go to your Google Tag Manager container, click on "Admin," then "User Management," and confirm you have publish access.
3. **Google Ads:** Go to your Google Ads account, navigate to "Admin Access and Security," and verify your access level.

## Installing the GTM Plugin on WordPress

To install the GTM plugin on your WordPress site, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Plugin:**
   - Go to your WordPress backend, click on "Plugins," then "Add New."
   - Search for "GTM for WP" and install the plugin by Thomas Geiger.
   - Activate the plugin.

2. **Configure the Plugin:**
   - After activation, you should be redirected to the plugin settings page.
   - If not, navigate to "Installed Plugins," scroll to "GTM for WP," and click on "Settings."
   - Enter your GTM container ID (found in your GTM account under "Admin").

### Important Note

After saving changes, ensure the container code is on. If it turns off automatically, turn it back on and save again.

## Verifying GTM Installation

It's crucial to verify that the GTM container is properly installed on your site. You can do this using the following methods:

1. **GTM Preview Mode:**
   - Go to your GTM account, click on "Workspaces," then "Preview."
   - This opens a temporary debug session. Connect it to your website to track events and check if tags are firing correctly.

2. **Google Tag Assistant Chrome Extension:**
   - Install the extension and check if the GTM container is firing properly. The tag should be blue or green (not red or yellow).

## Setting Up the Begin Checkout Event

1. **Configure WooCommerce Events:**
   - In your WordPress backend, navigate to the GTM plugin settings.
   - Click on the "Integration" tab and enable "Track e-commerce events."
   - Check the box for "Begin Checkout" and save changes.

2. **Test the Event:**
   - Go to your WooCommerce cart page and click "Proceed to Checkout."
   - In the GTM debug window, verify that the "Begin Checkout" event is firing.

## Creating Conversion Actions in Google Ads

1. **Create Conversion Action:**
   - Go to your Google Ads account, click on "Goals," then "Summary."
   - Click the plus button to create a new conversion action.
   - Select "Website" and enter your website URL. Click "Scan."

2. **Configure Conversion Action:**
   - Choose "Begin Checkout" as the category and set it as a primary conversion action.
   - Save and continue. Note down the conversion ID and label provided.

## Configuring Conversion Tracking Tags

1. **Add Conversion Linker Tag:**
   - In GTM, go to "Tags," click on "New," and select "Conversion Linker."
   - Set it to fire on all pages and save.

2. **Create Custom Event Trigger:**
   - Create a new trigger with a custom event named "Begin Checkout."
   - Configure the necessary variables: value, currency, and items array.

3. **Set Up Conversion Tracking Tag:**
   - Create a new tag for Google Ads Conversion Tracking.
   - Use the conversion ID and label from your Google Ads account.
   - Configure the tag to fire on the "Begin Checkout" event.

4. **Add Remarketing Tag:**
   - Create a new tag for Google Ads Remarketing.
   - Configure it with the conversion ID and label, and set it to fire on the "Begin Checkout" event.

## Testing and Debugging

1. **Use GTM Preview Mode:**
   - Open the debug window and test the "Begin Checkout" event on your WooCommerce site.
   - Verify that the conversion tracking and remarketing tags are firing correctly.

2. **Check Tag Assistant:**
   - Ensure the Google Ads tag is firing and the event data is accurate.

## Publishing Changes

1. **Submit GTM Container:**
   - In GTM, click on "Submit" to publish your changes.
   - Name the version and describe the changes made.

## Final Verification and Notes

1. **Verify in Google Ads:**
   - Wait for a few hours and check your Google Ads account to ensure conversions are being tracked.
   - Remember, conversions will only show if they happen through Google Ads campaigns.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully configured the "Begin Checkout" event in WooCommerce using GTM and Google Ads. This setup will help you track important conversion actions and optimize your ad campaigns effectively.
