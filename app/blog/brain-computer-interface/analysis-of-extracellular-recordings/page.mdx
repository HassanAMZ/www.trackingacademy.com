### Analysis of Extracellular Recordings

First Edition of Brain-Computer Interfaces: Foundations and Methods. Written by Fabien Lotte, Laurent Bougrain, Maureen Clerc, and Christophe Pouzat. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and ISTE Ltd. Computer-Brain Interfaces 1 8.8.1. The most used method is multiple extracellular recordings [BUZ 04].

<br />

On invertebrate brain slices and ganglia, recordings with potential-sensitive probes [ZEC 89, HOM 09] are conducted. Finally, although recordings made utilizing calcium-based fluorescence [HOM 09] are frequently discussed in the literature, the investigation of synchronization cannot be done with them due to their low resolution. These questions are addressed at the data processing stage known as spike sorting. We will see that the primary determining factor of the recorded signal is the distance between the current's source, or the neuron, and the electrode. The amplitude ratios depend on the location of the source and the recording sites when a fixed source (neuron) is used.

<br />

The most popular strategy is to incorporate numerous conductances spread in a non-homogeneous way throughout the membrane, assuming a genuine neuron shape. The desired current density can also be determined by applying the fundamental principles of Ohm's law and the law of conservation of charge if the value of the membrane potential "at each point" along the neuron is known. In the equation [8.3] I m (x, t) = a 2 I 4 e l 1 r(x), where V m is the transmembrane potential and r is the rate of action potential propagation inside or outside the membrane. It demonstrates that for an axon with a diameter of 0.5 m connected to soma with a diameter of 15 m, the extracellular potential develops faster than the radius to power 1.8; otherwise, the signal would be dominated by events occurring inside the soma.This effect is valid for axons with radii between 10 1, and 20 m, which corresponds to the range of values that have been found in non-myelinated cortical fibers. Both invertebrates and vertebrates have shown that the action potentials of the soma and axon are not the same. It is likely not well described the relationship between the effective emissions of the neuron and the action potentials captured by extracellular electrodes. Tetrodes can be used to categorize spikes that have identical shapes and amplitudes at one recording site but different characteristics at the other locations. It depicts the evolution of (the negative of the minimum value of)e as a function of electrode distance for a fixed axon radius. On the author's website, you may find data and a step-by-step explanation of how to analyze it using the software programs R 13 and Python 14.

<br />

The data used to create, in each section is real. A few things were streamlined, such as using one recording site when four were available. A two-step method was soon introduced [GER 64] after it was discovered that action potentials coming from two separate neurons could have the same peak amplitude but differing forms. With the naked eye, two occurrences belonging to the same class of shape or template were distinguished. In the book by Hastieet al., one of the most crucial elements of high-dimensional data analysis—of which spike sorting is an example—is given in a way that is both generic and very educational.

<br />

Physiologists never stopped exploring for more automated and effective alternatives. The set of all potentially observable occurrences in an experiment is known as the sample space. The definition of this space is the initial step in probabilistic modeling. A matrix of 267 rows—there are 267 events—and 45 columns—each event I is characterized by an ordered set of 45 amplitudes. Reducing the dimension along the principal components makes it simple to create domains, as demonstrated by Resolving Superposition (1972).

<br />

The words "collision" and "interference" are also used to describe this phenomenon in the literature. Early in the 1970s, this problem was identified, and solutions based on "manual" template matching were proposed. The dynamic nature of the amplitude profiles (and occasionally the form) of the action potentials generated by a neuron during high-frequency firing is depicted. Calvin's [CAL 73] method calls for human data processing and depends on a mix of amplitude reduction and interspike intervals during bursts. The process is comparable to template matching, but it presupposes that we have already assessed the distinctive shapes and patterns that are connected to each neuron.

<br />

Although it would be difficult to thoroughly explain the process of creating optimal filters here, we will do it by using the example of matched filters 23. Because the output of matched filters has not been tuned, they are poor for templates that they were not intended to match. The filter construction method described in [ROB 79] considerably lessens this issue. It won't be feasible to completely eradicate the interference if there are too many characteristic shapes that are too similar to one another.

<br />

The most common method is to add a large number of conductances dispersed unevenly over the membrane, assuming a real neuron structure. If the value of the membrane potential "at each location" along the neuron is known, the desired current density can also be calculated by using the fundamental laws of Ohm's law and charge conservation.
