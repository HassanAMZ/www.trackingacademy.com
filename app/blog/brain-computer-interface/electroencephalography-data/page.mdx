### Electroencephalography Data Preprocessing

Each electrode's electrical potential is measured by electroencephalography 1 in the form of a time signal. These measurements contain a substantial quantity of data that is employed in brain computer interfaces, cognitive sciences, and clinical diagnosis. An EEG should be adequately preprocessed before being read in order to denoise or filter the measurements and to extract various data. As stated in Chapter 1, an EEG performs measurements through a set of electrodes positioned on the scalp. Time signals that individually relate to an acquisition channel are how data are presented.

<br />
Potential differences between electrodes can be measured in a variety of ways, known
as montages. The sampling frequency determines both the size of the analyzable frequency
spectrum and the temporal resolution of observable phenomena. The sampling frequency
recommended by Shannon's sampling theory is larger than twice the target maximum
frequency [MAL 08]. Time signals, which each 106 Brain-Computer Interfaces 1 correlate
to a channel, are how raw EEG data is presented. We have shown that oscillations
(alpha and beta waves, etc.) from various brain regions can be found in the EEG.

<br />

At high frequencies, a discontinuous function's Fourier transform steadily declines, giving rise to artifactual components in its spectrum. The Gibbs phenomenon, often known as frequency alteration, is significant when considering regularity qualities. A recursion algorithm is the most used digital technique for computing the discrete Fourier transform (FFT). It only increases with the number of samples N by a factor of NlogN. The frequency spectrum in which several BCI indicators are found may potentially be unique to each patient.

<br />

It is possible to analyze brain rhythms by breaking down EEG data into their oscillatory components using the Fourier transform. Frequency analysis is frequently carried out in a time window that revolves around a selected moment and is allowed to move along the time axis. This results in a time-frequency representation and is referred to as a sliding window. Joint time-frequency concentration has a limit. A function is less concentrated around its average point the more time it is concentrated in.

<br />

The short-term Fourier transform (STFT) involves translating and modulating a symmetric real function to create a time-frequency atom around (u, ). However, a wavelet might be more suitable for some signal types that exhibit non-uniform fluctuations at various frequencies or at various times. The time-frequency spread of atoms is connected to the time-frequency resolution of the wavelet transform and the scalogram. For the convenient representation of localized occurrences in both time and frequency, use time-frequency atoms. The atoms most precisely reflect signals when they are arranged in a "dictionary," which is a phrase for a huge collection of atoms offering redundant representation.

<br />

To include atoms in the desired shape, dictionaries can be enhanced. Through dictionary learning, the detected signals themselves should be utilized to learn the waveforms of the atoms. A rough geographic representation can be made with 20 electrodes, and a pretty accurate continuous map of potential can be made with 64 electrodes. The electrical potential used in EEG measurements is the consequence of the superposition of many cerebral activity sources, which alter the electric potential on the scalp due to volume conduction. Although difficult, separating these many sources produces data that are closer to the underlying electrical brain activity.

<br />

The term "Surface Laplacian," which is most frequently applied in BCI, is a very rough approximation of the true S V, which simply subtracts the average of each channel's neighbors. Some methods go much further to recreate the typical cortical surface current, which is even nearer to the fundamental sources. An extended source on a surface S, oriented in the normal direction(r) at each position roofS, and whose amplitude is denoted(r): can be used to represent cortical activity. J p (r): M m=1 q m p m (r) or a dipole that is equivalent. Estimating the numberM of dipoles, their position pm, and their moment qm constitutes source reconstruction (a vector representing amplitude and orientation).

<br />

The Laplacian filter is frequently used in BCI, while more sophisticated spatial representations like source reconstruction or cortical density are rarely employed. Future developments in source reconstruction techniques should enhance BCI since they also help to fill a knowledge gap on the neurological mechanisms behind BCI. Data having a high signal-to-noise ratio are necessary for BCI PCA when using statistical representations. However, once approximated, the PCA rotation can be improved online using fresh data. The common spatial patterns (CSP) approach for binary classification applies the same idea.

<br />

Preprocessing can be used online or offline (to evaluate a dataset that has already been captured) (directly during BCI interaction). Reconstructing dipolar sources from cross-trial averaged signals is a popular practice. Sometimes the sequence in which processing is carried out matters, however this is not the case with linear processing.
