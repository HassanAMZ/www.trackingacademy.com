### Neurophysiological Markers for Passive Brain–Computer Interfaces

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that don't use actively directed brain activity to drive an effector are called "passive" BCIs. Instead, they use signals that are unintentionally produced by someone performing a task to improve man-machine communication. As we shall see, passive BCIs are capable of characterizing and quantifying various mental states. Different types of markers taken from target signals are used by BCIs. In research that focuses on differences in task complexity, the phrase "cognitive load" is employed.

Behavioral performance will decline with increasing levels of difficulty, whether it be an increase in reaction time or a drop in response accuracy. Increases in theta (4-8 Hz) or delta (0-4 Hz) power at central frontal sites are shown in conjunction with decreases in alpha power spectral density (8-14 Hz) in centro-parietal sites (e.g. Pz) during increases in cognitive load (i.e. Fz). As task complexity and mental load change, several studies also find fluctuations in the gamma frequency band. Similar challenges are faced by drone controllers, and in this instance as well, assessing cognitive load in real time can improve accuracy. The ability of subjects to retain a sufficient degree of sustained attention is impacted by mental weariness.

Low-frequency EEG activity gradually rises in response to a decrease in alertness capacity. According to electroencephalographic (EEG) data, a decline in vigilance is accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of P3 activity [KOE 92, MUR 05, OKE 06, SCH 09]. [KAT 09, ZHA 12] According to other authors, its latency also increases. Although still in the prototype stage, passive BCIs may one day be employed to improve traffic safety. The effect of the item's occurrence probability is present in selective attention.

By categorizing objects based on how frequently they appear, the P300 component is activated at parieto central and occipital locations. In the context of active BCIs, and more specifically for the P300 speller paradigm, this component is frequently explored as well. In a virtual environment, passive BCIs manage the distractions and encourage people to pay attention. By adjusting the appearance of obtrusive things in their simulated world, virtual reality enables pupils to overcome their challenges. A step toward developing systems that self-correct when they deliver a subpar response is using EEG to identify interaction mistakes.

<br />

Whether a machine is interacting with a human or a human is only watching the machine, error recognition may allow for the quick correction of subpar behavior. The ability to quickly choose between competing options is facilitated by emotions, and a choice can be influenced by an emotion's positive valence. Additionally, they have an impact on behaviors that fall under the categories of approach and avoidance. Theta band activity or evoked potential amplitude both make it easier to identify the level of arousal connected to a stimulus. The neurowear team's creation of Necomimi ears is a startling illustration of the kind of improvement we might gain from.

The goal of research should be to find markers that are resistant to operator task type and interactions between mental states.
