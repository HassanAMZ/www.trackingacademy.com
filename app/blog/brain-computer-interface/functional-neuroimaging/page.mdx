summary: Researchers can map the brain's activity using magnetic resonance imaging. A series of functional pictures that allow for tracking of brain activity at intervals of several minutes can be obtained. The neuroimaging modalities of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic electrophysiology (MEG) are truly complementary to one another. Commercially available technology is now available to simultaneously record EEG and fMRI data. The relationship between the two signals is still being studied.

### Functional Neuroimaging

Since the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging in the 1970s and 1980s, neuroimaging has advanced significantly. A strongB 0 magnetic field causes an atom's spin to align with the field, which is the basis for magnetic resonance. The amount of atoms present at each location in the brain are proportional to the signal produced by MRI. This method's key component involves employing gradient coils to gently alter the magnetic field in space, which allows for the encoding of space with frequency: the resonance frequency varies depending on where in the brain you are. It is possible to obtain a sequence of functional images that allow tracking of the brain's activity at intervals of many minutes by rapidly creating photos every 2 or 3 seconds.

It is possible to employ a Bonferroni adjustment, which assumes that the tests are independent and utilises a threshold of 0.05/n, for a small number of tests. False positive results will rise if the test is run repeatedly (for example, several million times). A multivariate technique called independent component analysis (ICA) enables the blind extraction of the data's structure. In resting state imaging, this type of analysis has provided outstanding findings and enables researchers to identify activity patterns that are consistent across patients. Correlation, which considers physiological variations like breathing and heartbeat, is the most basic approach.

The field of neuroimaging is very interested in Granger causation. Since it is frequently necessary to modify a physical system in order to quantify causality in that system, the term "causality" is debatable. The magnetic field on the surface of the head is measured using MEG. Each condition (a condition being a form of stimulation or a cognitive task) is calculated independently to determine the average response. To estimate reactions at each individual event and circumvent the limits of averaging, noise reduction techniques can be applied.

When attempting to pinpoint the precise site of that activity within the cerebral cortex, source localization techniques are helpful. The issue has been addressed in a number of ways, many of which are closely related to one another. A linear model that represents observed fields as the superposition of dipolar sources is the foundation of the majority of approaches. Independent component analysis breaks down the signal (of sensors' dimensions and time) into a sum of components, each of which has a time course and a corresponding spatial component (topography). Using ICA, it is possible to separate cognitive processes or remove components like blinking.

Such oscillations can be described both in terms of frequency and length using time-frequency analysis. There are various techniques that vary in their ability to recreate data within a specific range of time and frequency. It is possible to assess delays between brain areas using electrophysiology measures since they have a good temporal resolution. It is important to compute statistical maps in a manner similar to fMRI in order to be able to identify the active regions in a cognitive protocol. Bivariate analyses can have limitations, just like in fMRI, and moving on to multivariate analysis may be intriguing.

<br />

To record EEG and fMRI data simultaneously, it is now possible to obtain commercially available equipment. Research is ongoing in the area of the neurovascular connection between the two signals. EEG, MEG, and fMRI are three separate functional neuroimaging modalities that are actually complementary to one another. Within the temporal range of cerebral activities, EEG and MEG can reconstruct past brain activity. Direct reconstruction of activity coming from a 1 cubic mm or smaller voxel is achievable with fMRI.
