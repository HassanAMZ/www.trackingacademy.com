summary: The primary physiological signals that can be used to regulate an active or reactive BCI have been discussed. Slow changes in blood pressure, average cortical potential, and synchronizations and desynchronizations brought on by an event are a few examples. We discussed the indicators of an activity generated by an exogenous event in the context of reactive BCIs.

### Anatomy and Physiology

Finding meaningful connections between a person's mental task and measurements of physiological differences in brain activity is still a challenging issue. In an active BCI, the user initiates communication, which he or she then controls by voluntarily altering their mental state. When the interface recognises a particular type of mental activity, it determines that it has received a command after continuously analysing those variations. In an active BCI, the user makes spontaneous mental state changes. The technology recognises this variation and provides the user with enlightening feedback.

<br />

The user is stimulated by the system in a reactive BCI, and the user's brain responds to the stimuli. The level of invasiveness required by various types of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in order to get brain measurements is classified. It is feasible to identify the particular location of the brain area where activity changes occur because to good spatial resolution. Electrodes are positioned as near to the electrophysiological sources as possible in invasive BCIs, and the electrical signals that are being monitored do not pass through the muscles, skin, or skull. Table 4 lists physiological activities, measuring tools, the levels of spatial and temporal resolution offered by those tools, and the features of the respective BCIs.

<br />

Equipment for magnetoencephalography is cumbersome, expensive, and needs to be put in a completely isolated space. Functional imaging methods exhibit significant temporal imprecision linked to the dynamic of that signal. A BCI [BIR 06] already uses brain activity signals along with related measurement methods like magnetic resonance imaging and near infrared spectroscopy. In this chapter, we'll talk about electrophysiological activity, whose changes an electroencephalogram (EEG) on the skin can record and analyse to identify a marker. The direction of the variation, positive or negative relative to the average or baseline level, classifies a slow evolution of average brain potential (slow cortical potential).

<br />

Negative SCPs are caused by extremely slow synchronised excitatory postsynaptic potentials that are released by the pyramidal neurons' apical dendrites. A decline in cortical potential that is first sluggish and then quick causes BP, or preparedness potential, to appear in two phases. BP starts one to five seconds before a voluntary activity is carried out. SCPs are quantifiable even in patients with severe brain damage, which makes this marker intriguing. BP has been used to make predictions about a subject's intention to move, including the movement's direction and even which limb would be employed.

<br />

The synchronizations and desynchronizations associated with the event are the BCI indicators of an activity caused by an endogenous event that are most frequently employed. The majority of research on active BCI development has focused on ERDs/ERSs generated by a motor imaging task. They are generated for this mental task in the mu (f=8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequency ranges, which are conveniently measurable by a surface EEG. The cognitive techniques used by subjects to complete the difficult mental job of imagining movement without actually performing it vary greatly in practise. An operant conditioning strategy can also enhance a subject's ability to alter the amplitude of his or her sensorimotor rhythms for the purpose of regulating an active BCI.

<br />

EEG readings only show sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) when the patient is subjected to sensory stimulation of some kind. SEPs are distinct from ERPs and spontaneous potentials that have nothing to do with perception, like the spontaneous choice to carry out a particular movement. In the visual perception chain, a stable operating state is created by repeated simulations. Regan conducted the first human studies on steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in 1966. SSVEPs are intriguing markers for BCI implementation since they are simple to separate from EEG signals using only the most fundamental processing.

<br />

During visual stimulation at a frequency of 15 Hz, the EEG was recorded on a bipolar derivation on positions Oz and Cz. Therefore, repetitive tactile stimulation can also result in the detection of somatosensory evoked potentials (steady-state somatoethystereotomies). The community is still debating whether or not to use the steady-state SEPs as markers in a reactive BCI. In reaction to an unanticipated sensory experience, P3b is also activated. Its amplitude is connected with the strength of the surprise effect produced by the stimulus and has a frontocentral spatial distribution.

<br />

In some reactive BCIs, P3b signals are identified through the analysis of EEG data to pinpoint the precise stimuli that the user is concentrating their attention on. Since Farwell and Donchin's publication [FAR 88], P300 has been the evoked potential that reactive BCIs most frequently employ. High-speed stimulations, up to 10 stimuli per second, are made achievable by P300 BCIs, allowing for acceptable transmission delays.
