## Section 1: Setting Up Google Tag Manager on Shopify

To begin tracking, the first step is integrating Google Tag Manager with your Shopify store:

1. **Access GTM Account**: Log into your GTM account and note your container ID.
2. **Implement GTM Snippets**:
   - Go to your Shopify admin, navigate to Online Store > Themes.
   - In the theme editor, find the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
   - Insert the GTM head snippet below the opening `<head>` tag and the body snippet immediately after the opening `<body>` tag.
3. **Verify the Integration**:
   - Use GTM's 'Preview' mode to confirm that the container is firing correctly across all Shopify pages.

## Section 2: Implementing 'Add To Cart' Tracking in Shopify Using Google Tag Manager's Data Layer

This section is dedicated to integrating Google Tag Manager's `dataLayer` with a Shopify store to track the `custom_add_to_cart` event. This event is triggered each time a user accesses a product page and clicks the AddToCart button.

### Initial Setup of DataLayer in the Head Section

This part involves setting up the `dataLayer` array. If it isn't already in place, the code will initialize it. Specifically, it checks if the page is a product page and, if so, implements a 'datalayer-product' snippet.

<DataLayerCode type="addToCart" subType="head" />

### Embedding Product Details in DataLayer

Here, the code captures essential data when a product page is loaded:

1. It identifies the product's current variant.
2. An `itemObject` is created, holding key product information.
3. Upon the page's full load, this information is pushed to the `dataLayer`.

<DataLayerCode type="addToCart" subType="main" />

### Inserting DataLayer Code into the Theme

This section of code links the `head-datalayer` snippet to your Shopify theme. This is generally where the head datalayer code is placed. It should be added to the GTM Body Code.

<DataLayerCode type="addToCart" subType="theme" />

Steps for Integrating DataLayer Code Snippets into Shopify:

1. **Backup First:** Always create a backup of your current theme before any modifications.

2. **Access Theme Files:** Log into your Shopify Admin, navigate to Online Store > Themes. Under your live theme, click the "Actions" dropdown and choose "Edit code".

3. **Insert Head DataLayer Code:** Find `theme.liquid` in the left sidebar and add the "Head DataLayer Code" snippet within the `<head>` section.

4. **Place Product DataLayer Code:** Select "Add a new snippet" as per your Shopify version. Name it `datalayer-product.liquid`. Input the "Product DataLayer Code" snippet into this file and save.

5. **Apply Theme DataLayer Code:** Decide the placement (usually within the `<head>` of `theme.liquid`). Add the "Theme DataLayer Code" snippet accordingly and save your changes.

6. **Verification:** To test, visit a product page on your Shopify store and open the developer console in your browser. Check that the `custom_add_to_cart` event triggers and that the `dataLayer` reflects accurate product details.

Note: These steps are based on a standard Shopify configuration. Custom themes may require a different approach. Always conduct thorough tests before and after applying these changes.
