## Introduction to Shopify Customer Events

Shopify’s **Customer Event Section** is a new method of tracking eCommerce events, replacing the older **data layer**. Over the last few months, many Shopify stores have successfully migrated to this new setup. This guide will show you how to configure the **View Category Event** for the Facebook Pixel using **Google Tag Manager** in Shopify’s Customer Event Section.

We'll walk through a **4-step process**:

1. Add the data layer event code
2. Configure the Google Tag Manager container
3. Set up Facebook Pixel Tags
4. Track and verify the **View Category Event**

## Step 1: Adding Data Layer Event Code

To start, we need to add a **custom data layer event** to Shopify.

1. **Go to Shopify Settings**:

   - Log in to your Shopify store and navigate to the bottom-left corner to click **Settings**.
   - In **Settings**, find the **Customer Event** section.

2. **Add a Custom Pixel**:

   - At the top-right, you'll see the button **Add Custom Pixel**. Click it.

3. **Rename the Pixel**:

   - Since this pixel will trigger the **View Category Event** for Facebook (or Meta), rename it appropriately, like "Meta View Category Data Layer Event."

4. **Configure the Permissions**:

   - Set **Permissions** to "Not Required."
   - Set **Data Sale** to "Does Not Qualify as Data Sale."

5. **Add the Code Snippet**:
   - Remove any demo code and paste the **View Category Event** code into the section for adding your custom pixel code. You can find this snippet in the video’s description or a linked blog post.

<DataLayerCodeBlock fileName="view_item_list.js" />

## Step 2: Adding Google Tag Manager Container

Now that the data layer event is set up, it's time to integrate **Google Tag Manager**.

1. **Get the GTM Container ID**:

   - Log in to your **Google Tag Manager** (GTM) account and copy the **Container ID**.

2. **Add the Container ID to Shopify**:

   - Return to your Shopify store and paste the **Container ID** into the corresponding field.

3. **Connect the Pixel**:

   - After saving, click the **Connect** button to link the pixel to your Shopify store.

4. **Verify Connection**:
   - Go to the **Online Store** and use **Inspect** mode in your browser’s console to ensure the data layer event is firing correctly. You should see the **View Item List Event** triggered along with product details like item name, value, and currency.

## Step 3: Configuring Facebook Pixel Tags

With the **data layer event** and **GTM container** set up, we can now configure the **Facebook Pixel tags** in GTM.

1. **Create a New Tag in GTM**:

   - In **GTM**, create a new tag. You can either use a **custom HTML tag** or import a **tag from the template gallery**.

2. **Choose the Facebook Pixel Tag**:

   - Search for **Facebook Pixel** in the template gallery and select the one managed by Facebook AR. Add it to your workspace.

3. **Add the Facebook Pixel ID**:

   - Get your **Facebook Pixel ID** from **Facebook Events Manager**.
   - In **GTM**, create a constant variable named **Meta Pixel ID** and save it. This avoids manually copying and pasting the ID multiple times.

4. **Set Up the Page View Event**:

   - Set this tag to fire on **all pages** or only on specific page views, as needed.

5. **Configure View Category Event**:
   - Create another custom event trigger for **View Category**. Name it accordingly and set it to fire only when the **View Item List Event** from the data layer is triggered.

## Step 4: Tracking View Category Events on Facebook Pixel

For the **View Category Event**, we will pass additional information from the data layer, like product IDs and names, to Facebook.

1. **Import the E-Commerce Parameter Generator Template**:

   - From the video description or blog post, download the **e-commerce parameter generator template** (TPL file).
   - Go to **GTM → Template → Custom Variables** and import this template.

2. **Create a New Variable**:

   - Use the imported template to create a variable that pulls **e-commerce data** from the **data layer** (like product names, IDs, and currency).

3. **Link the Variable to the Tag**:

   - Go back to your **View Category Tag** and link the newly created variable that contains the **e-commerce parameters**.

4. **Publish the Changes**:
   - Once everything is set up, publish your changes in **Google Tag Manager**.

## Verifying Pixel Events in Shopify

Before we wrap up, let’s verify that everything works as expected.

1. **Test the Pixel Events**:

   - Visit your Shopify store’s frontend and go to a category page.
   - Use the **Meta Pixel Helper** browser extension to verify that the **View Category Event** has fired. The event should include the **content IDs**, **content array**, **currency**, and other parameters.

2. **Check in Facebook Events Manager**:
   - In **Facebook Events Manager**, go to the **Test Events** section, enter your store URL, and open the site.
   - You should see both the **Page View Event** and the **View Category Event** listed.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you’ve successfully set up and tested the **View Category Event** using Shopify’s new **Customer Event Section** and **Google Tag Manager**. This method ensures you can track customer interactions efficiently, helping improve your store’s performance and marketing strategies.
