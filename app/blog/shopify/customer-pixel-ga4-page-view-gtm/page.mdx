In this guide, you'll learn how to set up Google Analytics page view tracking on your Shopify store using Google Tag Manager (GTM). We'll walk through each step, ensuring your setup is efficient and effective.

## Step 1: Accessing Shopify and Setting Up Google Tag Manager

### 1.1. Ensure Proper Access to Shopify

Before starting, you need to have the correct access rights in your Shopify store:

1. **Log into Shopify** and navigate to the **Settings** section.
2. Verify that you have access to the **Customer Events** section, where you can create and manage customer pixels.

### 1.2. Create a Google Tag Manager Container

If you don't already have a Google Tag Manager container, follow these steps:

1. **Log into your Google Tag Manager account.**
2. Click on **Create Container**.
3. **Name your container** and select "Web" as the platform.
4. **Create the container**.

If you're working with a client, ensure you have the necessary permissions (like publish access) by checking the **User Management** section under the container's settings.

### 1.3. Verify Google Analytics Access

Make sure you have **admin or editor access** to the Google Analytics account you plan to use:

1. Go to the **Google Analytics** account.
2. Click on the **Admin** section.
3. Check your access level under **Property Access Management**.

## Step 2: Connecting Google Tag Manager to Shopify

### 2.1. Obtain the GTM Container Code

To link your GTM container to Shopify:

1. Open your **GTM container** and locate the **container code**.
2. Copy the JavaScript code provided.

### 2.2. Add the GTM Code to Shopify

1. Go back to the **Shopify backend**.
2. Under **Settings**, navigate to **Customer Events** and click **Add Custom Pixel**.
3. **Name the pixel** (e.g., "Data Layer Code for Google Tag Manager").
4. **Paste the GTM code** into the code section.
5. Ensure the settings are as follows:
   - **Permissions:** Not required.
   - **Data Sale:** Selected as "does not qualify as data sales".
6. **Save and connect** the pixel.

### 2.3. Understanding Customer Pixels and the Sandbox Environment

Customer pixels in Shopify operate inside a sandbox, which means:

- The GTM code runs within an iframe.
- Although the sandbox restricts access to the parent website, it still allows event tracking.

You can verify that the GTM container is firing correctly by using the **Google Tag Assistant Legacy Chrome extension**.

## Step 3: Adding a Google Analytics Page View Event

### 3.1. Create the Required Tags, Triggers, and Variables

Now that your GTM container is active on your Shopify site, the next step is to configure the page view event.

1. **Create a new tag** in GTM:

   - Click on **New** under the **Tags** section.
   - Since this event is for all pages, use the trigger for **all pages**.

2. **Configure the custom event trigger**:

   - Click the **+** button to create a new custom event trigger.
   - Name the trigger (e.g., "Custom Event PageView").
   - Save the trigger.

3. **Add the measurement ID from Google Analytics**:

   - Go to your **Google Analytics 4** account and find the **Measurement ID**.
   - In GTM, create a new variable (e.g., "G4 Measurement ID Prod") using the constant variable type.
   - Save the variable.

4. **Create a Configuration Tag** in GTM:
   - Use the **Measurement ID** variable you created.
   - Save the configuration tag.

### 3.2. Publish the GTM Container

Since the standard preview mode won't work with customer pixels, you need to **publish the container** to test it:

1. Name the container (e.g., "G4 Page View Event").
2. Click **Publish**.

## Step 4: Verifying the Event Firing in Google Analytics

To ensure your page view event is correctly firing:

1. Go to the **Networks tab** on your website's backend.
2. Filter for the request called **collect** and refresh the page.
3. Check if the Google Analytics tag fired by using the **Legacy Chrome extension**.
4. Alternatively, check the **Real-Time** view in Google Analytics to see if users are being tracked.

## Summary

Here's a quick recap of what we covered:

- We added a Google Tag Manager container using a custom pixel in Shopify.
- We configured a page view event to fire inside a sandbox.
- We created the necessary tags, triggers, and variables in GTM.
- Finally, we verified that the page view event was working properly in Google Analytics.
