## Introduction

Google Analytics provides us invaluable insights into our store's performance and customer behavior without the need for deep technical knowledge. It's a must-have for Shopify store owners who aim to optimize their business operations.

Fear not; our guide ensures a smooth and hassle-free experience, breaking down every step for you.

Don't worry; we're keeping things simple and straightforward.

### Here's what we'll cover:

## Two Main Approaches to Shopify Analytics Setup

There are two primary methods to achieve this:

1. Utilizing Google's channel integrated with Shopify, providing a holistic solution to most tracking needs.
2. A more custom and robust approach using Google Tag Manager's web and server containers.

In this guide, we'll focus on the first option, employing Google and YouTube sales channels for Shopify to monitor events on GA4.

## Advantages and Drawbacks of Google's Built-in Channel

This process is fairly straightforward. However, one significant drawback is its inability to track all traffic. Estimates show tracking rates of around 60% to 90%. Factors like ad blockers, iOS's ITP restrictions, and EU data protection regulations hinder complete tracking.

The alternative, shifting from Google's built-in channel to Google Tag Manager, demands more resources, but we'll tackle that in another blog.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. You have a Shopify store.
2. A Google Analytics 4 account is set up.

## Creating a Google Analytics 4 Account

If you're new to GA4:

1. Visit [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/)
2. Follow the account creation process, naming your property (e.g., "Tracking Academy").
3. Enter your website details and proceed through the setup.

## Data Stream Setup

A data stream is a conduit transporting data from Shopify to GA4. Here's how to set one up:

1. Under "Property" in GA4, select "Data Streams".
2. Choose the appropriate stream type (web, for Shopify).
3. Enter website details and create the stream.
4. Make note of the provided "measurement ID"; you'll need it for installation.

## Integrating Google and YouTube Channels in Shopify

1. In your Shopify dashboard, navigate to "Sales Channels".
2. Search and select "[Google and YouTube](https://apps.shopify.com/google)".
3. Install the sales channel, then authorize the app for complete integration.
4. Connect the appropriate GA4 property.

To validate, visit your Shopify store. You can also use [Chrome extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk) to check for Global Site Tags, which Google uses to dispatch various tags.

## Testing the Integration

Perform actions like viewing items, adding to cart, and starting checkout. Then, return to GA4 to ensure these events are being logged correctly.

## Making a Test Purchase

1. Add an item to your cart and proceed to checkout.
2. Use dummy user data to simulate the purchase process.
3. Return to GA4 to verify that events like "add payment info" and "purchase" are being captured.

## Upsell Tracking

If you utilize upsell tracking, ensure the integration captures upsell events correctly. Perform a test purchase and confirm that upsell-related events are being recorded in GA4.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right configuration and ensuring that all events are correctly tracked is vital for getting accurate analytics data. While Shopify's built-in tools and the Google and YouTube sales channels offer a simplified way to connect with Google Analytics, it's important to note their limitations. For businesses that require more detailed tracking or those operating in regions with strict user privacy regulations, additional configurations or tools may be necessary.

influence their e-commerce strategies. Remember to regularly review and refine your
configurations to keep up with evolving business needs and digital landscapes.
