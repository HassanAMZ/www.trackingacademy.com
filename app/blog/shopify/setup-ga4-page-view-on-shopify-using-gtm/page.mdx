## Initial Steps: Setting Up Google Analytics and Tag Manager Accounts

1. If you've already set up your Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager accounts, you can skip to the next section. If not, you'll need to create your Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager accounts.
2. Ensure that you have the [**Google Tag Assistant Chrome extensions**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk) installed.

## Installing the Google Tag Manager (GTM) Container on Shopify

1. Log in to your GTM account.
2. Navigate to the **Admin** section and select **Container Settings**.
3. Under the install section, you'll find two tracking snippets. One is for the `<head>` and the other is for the `<body>` section of your site.
4. Copy the tracking code for the `<head>`.
5. On your Shopify dashboard, navigate to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
6. Click on **Edit Code** and locate the `theme.liquid` file.
7. Find the `<head>` tag and paste the GTM tracking code you copied.
8. Return to GTM and grab the tracking code for the `<body>`.
9. Back in the `theme.liquid` file, search for the `<body>` tag and paste the second tracking code in the next line.
10. Save your changes.

## Verifying GTM Installation

1. Visit your Shopify store.
2. Use the [**Google Tag Assistant Chrome extensions**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-legacy-by-g/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk) to check if GTM is correctly implemented. It should indicate that a GTM container has been found on the website.

## Integrating Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

1. In your GA4 account, click on **Admin** located at the bottom left.
2. Go to **Property Settings** > **Data Streams**.
3. Locate the relevant data stream (e.g., Web for Shopify) and copy the **Measurement ID** (G-XXXXXXXX).
4. Return to your GTM workspace.
5. Navigate to **Variables** and create a constant variable named "GA4 Measurement ID" with the copied ID.
6. Now, go to **Tags** > **New**.
7. Select **Google Tag** as the tag type.
8. Insert your "GA4 Measurement ID" variable in Google Tag.
9. Save your changes, rename the Tag to "GT GA4 Configuration Tag" and preview the workspace to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
10. If all goes well, GA4 should now be capturing data from your Shopify store!
