## CSC Scholarship Interview NPU Xi'an China for MS. Electrical Engineering 2021

In this blog post, we will discuss the interview experience for the CSC Scholarship at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in Xi'an, China. The interview was conducted for the Master's program in Electrical Engineering, specifically in the field of control sciences and engineering.

## Duration of the Interview

The duration of the interview was approximately 5 minutes.

## The Interview Panel

The interview panel consisted of four members, including the supervisor of the Control Science and Engineering department at NPU, along with three members from the CSC Scholarship Council.

- Prof. Yu (Supervisor)
- Three members from the CSC Scholarship Council

## Types of Questions

The interview consisted of two types of questions: non-academic and academic.

### Non-Academic Questions

The non-academic questions focused on getting to know the candidate better. The following three questions were asked by the CSC Council members:

1. Introduction: The candidate was asked to introduce themselves.
2. Work experience: The candidate was asked about any relevant work experience they had.
3. Why NPU: The candidate was asked why they chose NPU and what they knew about the university.

### Academic Questions

The academic questions were posed by Prof. Yu and aimed to assess the candidate's technical knowledge. The two academic questions asked were:

1. PID controllers in open and closed-loop systems: The candidate was asked to explain the concept of PID controllers and their application in open and closed-loop control systems.
2. Graduation university and major: The candidate was asked about their undergraduate university and major.

This interview experience provided valuable insights into the interview process for the CSC Scholarship at NPU for the Master's program in Electrical Engineering. It highlighted the importance of being prepared for both non-academic and academic questions.
