## Updates 7th Nov 2022:

We have decided to test a few more things in this month of November regarding cover letters. The first change is that we are not going to send the turnaround time and budget of the project inside the cover letter. We are also removing the self-praising paragraph (I’m a top-rated freelancer etc.). The new structure of the cover letter should answer the following questions for the client.

### Checklsit before sending cover letter:

1. Have you read the job?
2. What is the issue/problem?
3. Do you have a solution for that?
4. Request for meeting time?
5. P.S. Have you done it for someone else?

Hi,

Your WordPress website (Renorocket.ca) is primarily a lead generation website, and currently, there are multiple integrations of Google Analytics through Google site kit and Google tag manager, which are sending multiple pageview events for each user.

We can remove the Google site kit plug-in and configure everything using Google tag manager so that we will have more control over the events. Google Analytics 4 is only tracking the page events; we can also configure form submission events for universal analytics and Google Analytics 4.

I would love to talk more about the Job. Let me know if you're available for a meeting.

-Hassan

P.S. I have configured lead generation events for wordpress sites for many clients and one of them is a 5-star job on my profile from paul.

Hi,

Configuring Google Analytics 4 via the Google tag manager server container is not absolutely necessary however it is a good practice as moving forward the browsers will not let Google Analytics track data as it has been happening to Facebook pixel for about one year now.

I would love to talk more about the Job. Let me know if you're available for a meeting.

-Hassan

P.S. I have configured google analytics 4 for NextJs, ReactJs sites for many WebApp clients and one of them is a 5-star job on my profile from John.
