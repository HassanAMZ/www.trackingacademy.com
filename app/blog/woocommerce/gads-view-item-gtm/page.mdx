   - Save changes.

2. **Test Data Layer:**

### Step 7: Set Up Variables

   - For value: `ecommerce.value`
   - For items array: `ecommerce.items`

### Step 8: Add Conversion Tracking Tag

1. **Configure Tag:**

   - In GTM, create a new **Google Ads Conversion Tracking** tag.
   - Use the conversion ID and label from Google Ads.
   - Set the value, currency, and items from the data layer variables.
   - Name and save the tag.

2. **Add Remarketing Tag:**
   - Create a **Google Ads Remarketing** tag.
   - Enable dynamic remarketing and set the event to `view_item`.
   - Use the same variables for value and items.
   - Name and save the tag.

## Testing and Verifying Tags

### Step 9: Test Tags in Debug Mode

1. **Open Debug Window:**
   - Visit a product page and ensure the **view item** event fires.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

### Step 10: Publish Changes
