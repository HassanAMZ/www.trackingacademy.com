summary: Assuming known stationary signal and noise spectra and additive noise, the Wiener filter is a filter used in signal processing to provide an estimate of a desired or target random process through linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering of an observed noisy process. The mean square error between the intended process and the estimated random process is reduced by the Wiener filter.

### Overview:

Using measurable empirical data with a random component, estimation theory is a subfield of statistics that deals with estimating parameter values. The parameters represent an underlying physical environment in such a way that the distribution of the measured data is influenced by the parameters' values. Using the measurements, an estimator tries to approximate the unknown parameters. In estimating theory, two methods are typically considered

1. The article's description of the probabilistic approach assumes that the measured data is random and that the parameters of interest affect its probability distribution.

2. The set-membership approach assumes that the parameter vector-dependent set to which the observed data vector belongs.

Assuming known stationary signal and noise spectra and additive noise, the Wiener filter is a filter used in signal processing to provide an estimate of a desired or target random process through linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering of an observed noisy process. The mean square error between the intended process and the estimated random process is reduced by the Wiener filter.

### Gaussian Noise Generation:

Statistical noise with a probability density function (PDF) that is identical to that of the Gaussian distribution is known as gaussian noise. In other words, the noise's possible values have a Gaussian distribution. Left to right, Figure 1 displays a few Gaussian noisy images: σ1 = 10, σ2 = 20, σ3 = 30, and figure 2 shows how to implement σ1, σ2, σ3 by determining rms values.

### Wiener Filter Implementation

```

F ̂(u,v)=[(H * (u,v))/(H (u,v)|2+K)]G(u,v)

```

In which,

```

𝐹̂(𝑢, 𝑣) = the estimate
𝐺(𝑢, 𝑣) = degraded image
𝐻(𝑢, 𝑣) = degradation function
𝐻∗(𝑢, 𝑣) = complex conjugate of 𝐻(𝑢, 𝑣)
𝐾 = constant

```

Eq. (1) expresses Wiener Filter and it is applied in the frequency domain. Figure 5 shows an implementation of Wiener Filter using Python. a, b) Construct Wiener Filter and apply it to noisy image

```python
def wiener_filter(img, kernel, K):
	kernel /= np.sum(kernel)
	dummy = np.copy(img)
	dummy = fft2(dummy)
	kernel = fft2(kernel, s = img.shape)
	kernel = np.conj(kernel) / (np.abs(kernel) ** 2 + K)
	dummy = dummy * kernel
	dummy = np.abs(ifft2(dummy))
	return dummy

def gaussian_kernel(kernel_size = 3):
	h = gaussian(kernel_size, kernel_size / 3).reshape(kernel_size, 1)
	h = np.dot(h, h.transpose())
	h /= np.sum(h)
	return h
```

```python
# Load image and convert it to gray scale
file_name = os. path.join('lena1000p.jpg')
img = rgb2gray(plt.imread(file_name))

# Blur the image
blurred_img = blur(img, kernel_size = 7)

# Add Gaussian noise
noisy_img_1 = add_gaussian_noise(blurred_img, sigma = 10)
noisy_img_2 = add gaussian_noise(blurred_img, sigma = 20)
noisy_img_3 - add_gaussian_noise(blurred_img, sigma = 30)

# Apply Wiener Filter
kernel = gaussian_kernel(5)
filtered_img_1 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_1, kernel, K = 10)
filtered_img_2 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_2, kernel, K = 10)
filtered_img_3 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_3, kernel, K = 10)
```

Figure 6 shows the results of using the Wiener Filter to restore noisy images. The first three images are blurred and have Gaussian noise added to them with sigma values of 10, 20, and 30, respectively. The remaining images are the outcomes of applying the Wiener Filter in accordance with the first three degraded images. Figure 7 shows an implementation to calculate the Wiener Filter's rms error.

Calculate rms error

```python
# Load image and convert it to gray scale
file_name = os. path.join('lena1000p.jpg')
img = rgb2gray(plt.imread(file_name))

# Add Gaussian noise
noisy_img_1 = add_gaussian_noise(img, sigma = 10)
noisy_img_2 = add_gaussian_noise(img, sigma = 20)
noisy_img_3 = add_gaussian_noise (img, sigma = 30)

# Apply Wiener Filter
kernel = gaussian_kernel(5)
filtered_img_1 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_1, kernel, K = 10)
filtered_img_2 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_2, kernel, K = 10)
filtered_img_3 = wiener_filter(noisy_img_3, kernel, K = 10)
```

```python
def wiener_rms (original, wiener):
    return np.sqrt(np.mean((wiener - original)
```

```python

### Median Filter Implementation:

Median Filter computes the median of all the pixels under the kernel window and the central pixel is replaced with this median value. This is highly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise. a, b) Apply Median Filter to noisy image

```python
def median_filter(data, kernel_size):
    temp = []
    indexer = kernel_size // 2
    data_final = []
    data_final = np.zeros((len(data),len(data[0])))
    for i in range(len(data)):

        for j in range(len(data[0])):

            for z in range(kernel_size):
                if i + z - indexer < 0 or i + z - indexer > len(data) - 1:
                    for c in range(kernel_size):
                        temp.append(0)
                else:
                    if j + z - indexer < 0 or j + indexer > len(data[0]) - 1:
                        temp.append(0)
                    else:
                        for k in range(kernel_size):
                            temp.append(data[i + z - indexer][j + k - indexer])

            temp.sort()
            data_final[i][j] = temp[len(temp) // 2]
            temp = []
    return data_final

```

```python
# Load image and convert it to gray scale
file_name = os. path.join('lena1080p.jpg)
img = rgb2gray(plt.imread(file_name))
# Add Gaussian noise
noisy_img_1 = add_gaussian_noise(img, sigma = 10)
noisy_img_2 = add_gaussian_noise(img, sigma = 20)
noisy_img_3 = add_gaussian_noise(img, sigma - 30)
# Apply Median Filter
filtered_img_1 - median_filter(noisy_img_1, 3)
filtered_img_2 - median_filter(noisy_img_2, 3)
filtered_img_3 = median_filter(noisy_img_3, 3)
```

### Comparison of Wiener Filter and Median Filter

Figure 11. Comparison of Wiener Filter and Median Filter.
Figure 11 demonstrates the effectiveness of Median Filter and Wiener Filter in restoring degraded images. Previously, the 3x3 and 5x5 kernel sizes were used to denoise the images, but they might yield the same effect. Thus, the kernel size was increased up to 9x9 and the result showed the difference more clearly. It could be said that Wiener Filter outperforms Median Filter, Median Filter can reduce noise well but the output image would be less clear than that of Wiener Filter, meanwhile, Wiener Filter produced a favorable result for simultaneously deblurring and denoising.
