{/* This is a proper JSX-style comment in MDX */}

## What is Among Man?

Among Man is a fictional character we'll use to demonstrate React concepts. It's inspired by popular social deduction games.

## Creating the Among Man Component

Let's start by creating a basic React component for our Among Man:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const AmongMan = ({ color }) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        width: "100px",
        height: "120px",
        backgroundColor: color,
        borderRadius: "50px 50px 25px 25px",
        position: "relative",
      }}
    >
      {/* Visor */}
      <div
        style={{
          width: "60px",
          height: "30px",
          backgroundColor: "#A0E0FF",
          borderRadius: "25px 25px 0 0",
          position: "absolute",
          top: "25px",
          left: "20px",
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AmongMan;
```
