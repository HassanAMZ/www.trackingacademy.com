    question:
      "What's the difference between Client-Side and Server-Side tracking?",
    answer:
      "Client-Side Tracking (CST) happens in the user's browser and is vulnerable to ad blockers, privacy settings, and browser restrictions, resulting in only 60-70% accuracy. Server-Side Tracking (SST) processes data on secure servers, bypassing these limitations to achieve 95%+ accuracy while maintaining user privacy and compliance with regulations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does implementation take?",
    answer:
      "Basic audits can be completed within 1-2 days. Professional CST setup typically takes 3-5 days. Advanced tracking with both CST and SST implementation usually takes 5-7 days. Enterprise solutions with full compliance may take 7-10 days depending on complexity.",

  {
    question: "How accurate is your tracking compared to standard solutions?",
    answer:
      "Standard client-side tracking typically captures only 60-70% of conversions due to ad blockers, privacy settings, and browser restrictions. Our advanced server-side tracking solutions achieve 95%+ accuracy, recovering the 'invisible' conversions that most businesses are missing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with restricted or banned niches?",
