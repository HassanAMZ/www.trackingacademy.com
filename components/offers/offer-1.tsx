          One word â€“ complexity.

        <Text as="p" variant="bodyMd">
          Implementing precise tracking is hard because it requires a deep understanding of multiple
          systems and platforms. And unless you're a full-time data analyst with no other
          responsibilities, tracking accuracy is probably something you don't have a lot of time to
          focus on.

          Sure, if you're a tech-savvy marketer with unlimited resources, you could probably figure
          it out given enough time. But if you're like most marketers, and you've got an actual
          business to run, or clients to manage, or you just don't have 40+ hours a week to devote
          to perfecting your tracking setup, things are a lot harder.

        <Text as="p" variant="bodyMd" className="mb-8">
          To achieve 95%+ tracking accuracy, you've got to master a bunch of different skills, some
